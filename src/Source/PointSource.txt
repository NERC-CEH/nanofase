PointSource specification
A point source should refer to the RiverReach into which it discharges.
PointSources are stored at GridCell level, so the reference must contain:
i.  A SubRiver reference
ii. A RiverReach reference
How to store the time series inputs for a point source?
Time series inputs may be of several natures - so this requires further discussion
 - what timestep is used - specified annual inputs broken down by day in the model itself
                         - specified daily inputs
                         - annual time trend using an equation
                         - polymorphism may help us here - can define different types of point source input
- inputs of what? water, SPM
- is there value in defining surface runoff and erosion as point sources, so that
  every RiverReach has an associated PointSource?
